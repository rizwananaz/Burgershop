            <p>Fast food refers to quickly prepared and served meals that are typically high in calories, fats, and sugars. Common examples include burgers, fries, pizzas, and fried chicken. It's popular for its convenience, affordability, and widespread availability, especially in urban areas. Major global chains like McDonaldâ€™s, KFC, and Burger King dominate the industry. While fast food satisfies hunger on the go, regular consumption can contribute to health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Recently, healthier fast food options and plant-based alternatives have emerged in response to growing health awareness. Despite criticism, fast food remains a staple in modern lifestyles.</p>
